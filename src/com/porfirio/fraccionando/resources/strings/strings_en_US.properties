CAL_MCD_IND=We will calculate the maximum common divisor (MCD) of the following numbers:
CAL_MCD_SX_EXP=The maximum common divisor (MCD) is the biggest number that a group of numbers is divisible by.
CAL_MCD_SX_INT=To calculate it, we have a test value that will start with 2, and we will divide all of the numbers by that test value, if the division of all of the numbers is exact, the test value will become a factor of the maximum common divisor (MCD).We continue testing with the same test value and when one of the divisions is not exact, then the test value increases to the next whole number and this same process is repeated. The calculation process ends when the test value becomes equal to one of the numbers.
CAL_MCD_SX_RES=The MCD is equal to the product of the factors that were found.
CAL_MCM_IND=We will calculate the least common multiple of the following numbers: 
CAL_MCM_NX_RES=The lcm is:
CAL_MCM_SX_EXP=The least common multiple (lcm) is the smallest number that is divisible by a group of numbers.
CAL_MCM_SX_INT=To calculate it, we have test value that will start with 2, and we will divide all of the numbers by that test value. If the division of at least one of the numbers is exact, then the test value will become a factor of the least common multiple (lcm). We continue testing with the same test value and when none of the divisions is exact, then the test value increases to the next whole number and this same process is repeated. The calculation process ends when in the process of finding the factors of the lcm results in the original numbers becoming 1.
CAL_MCM_SX_RES=The lcm is equal to the product of the factors that were found.
DIVS_NX=The fractions are divided by pairs:
DIVS_SX=The division of more than 2 fractions is solved by grouping in pairs the fractions and solving one by one the pairs of simple division.
DIV_SIM_NX=It is then solved with diagonal multiplications among the fractions:
DIV_SIM_SX=To resolve the division of two fractions, two diagonal multiplications of the 2 fractions have to be performed. The numerator of the final result is equal to the product of the numerator of the first fraction and the second fraction, and the denominator is equal to the product of the numerator of the second fraction by the denominator of the first.
FR_CAI_DEN_EXA=We will establish 1 as the denominator of the fraction
FR_CAI_IND=Change to an improper fraction the following fraction:
FR_CAI_SX_DES=A fraction that is expressed as a whole number plus a fractional part is a mixed fraction. The whole number of the mixed fraction can be added to its fractional part to change this mixed fraction to an improper fraction.
FR_CAI_SX_OPE=The numerator of the improper fraction is the result of the whole number of the mixed fraction multiplied by the denominator of its fractional part plus the numerator of the fractional part. The whole number is eliminated and the denominator remains the same.
FR_CAM_IND=Change to a mixed number, the following fraction:
FR_CAM_NOIMP=This fraction is not improper, therefore, it can not be changed to a mixed fraction.
FR_CAM_NOMIX=This is not a mixed fraction, it can not be converted.
FR_CAM_NOSIMP=This fraction is not an improper fraction nor reducible, it can not be simplified.
FR_CAM_SX_CIII_ENT=The whole number of the mixed fraction will be added to the whole number of another mixed fraction.
FR_CAM_SX_CIII_MIX=But if the fraction is a mixed fraction, we will only deal with the fractional part of the mixed fraction.
FR_CAM_SX_CII_EXA=In some fractions, there will be an exact and complete division where the result will be only a whole number and it can be proved using the following operation:
FR_CAM_SX_DES=A fraction where the numerator is bigger than the denominator is improper. This means that it contains a whole number that can be extracted and from there a mixed number or mixed fraction can be obtained.
FR_CAM_SX_DET_DEN=Finally, the denominator of the mixed fraction will remain the same.
FR_CAM_SX_DET_ENT=The whole number results from dividing the numerator by the denominator plus a fraction.
FR_CAM_SX_DET_NUM=The numerator of the mixed fraction results from multiplying the whole number by the denominator and subtracting the result from the numerator of the original fraction;
FR_RESULTADO=What we end up with as the final result: 
FR_SIM_IND=Simplify the following fraction:
FR_SIM_MCD=We must find the maximum common divisor (MCD) where we can divide the numerator and the denominator by this number, evenly.
FR_SIM_SX_CAM=Comparing the numerator with the denominator where the numerator is a bigger number, this fraction is an improper fraction and it can be converted to a mixed fraction.
FR_SIM_SX_DIV=Finally, we divide the numerator and the denominator by the MCD that we have just calculated.
FR_SIM_SX_INT=To simplify a fraction means to reduce it to a more simple fraction.
FR_SIM_SX_UNI_MIX=As the numerator and denominator are the same, the fractional part has a value of 1, so it only add to the value of the whole part.
FR_SIM_SX_UNI_NOMIX=A fraction in which the numerator and denominator are equal, is called fraction unit, so its value is 1.
FUN_CAI_FRACS_RES=Fractions are as follows after conversion.
FUN_DET_EQU=It will be determined if the following fractions are equivalent.
FUN_DET_MAY=It will be determined which one of the following fractions is the biggest:
FUN_DET_REC=It will be determined if the following fractions are reciprocal:
FUN_INST_EQU=Two fractions are equivalent if the products of the numerator of one fraction bye the denominator of the other fraction are equal.
FUN_INST_MAY=To find out which of the fractions is bigger we multiply the numerator of one fraction by the denominator of the other and in these multiplications, which will be two of them, from the resulting multiplications, the one with the biggest value, its first multiplier will be the numerator of the biggest fraction that we are finding.
FUN_INST_REC=Two fractions are reciprocal if the product of their numerators is equal to the product of their denominators.
FUN_PLT=Therefore:
FUN_RES_IGU=The fractions are equal
FUN_RES_MAY=The biggest is:
FUN_RES_NO_EQU=The fractions are not equivalent.
FUN_RES_NO_REC=The fractions are not reciprocal.
FUN_RES_SI_EQU=The fractions are equivalent.
FUN_RES_SI_REC=The fractions are reciprocal.
MIX_NX_GRUP=The multiplications and divisions are grouped and then they are solved:
MIX_NX_SUMRES=The additions and subtractions are solved:
MIX_SX_GRUP=When we have an operation where there is a combination of additions or subtractions with multiplications or divisions, change the order of the sequence of the operation. First solve the multiplications and divisions and finally the additions and subtractions. What we will do is group the operations in that way:
MIX_SX_PAREN=We first solve the operations that are inside the parenthesis:
MIX_SX_SUMRES=At the end, we solved the remaining additions and subtractions: 
MUL_DIV_NX_GRUP=The first fraction is grouped with the multiplications and then solved, afterwards the divisions are solved.
MUL_DIV_SX_GRUP=To solve an operation where we have multiplications and divisions together, we first group the first fraction with the other fractions that will be multiplied; after we have this result, we divide this result by the next fraction and then we divide this result by the following fraction and continue this process until we finish with the divisions.
MUL_NX=The numerators are multiplied as indicated, and the same with the denominators:
MUL_SX=The numerator of the final result of the multiplication of fractions is equal to the product of the numerators, and at the same time, the denominator is equal to the product of the denominators:
OPE_EMP_ESM=This fraction is a mixed fraction:
OPE_INI=The following operation will be resolved:
OPE_NX_CAI=We convert the mixed fractions to improper fractions:
OPE_NX_RES_SIM=The simplified fraction is:
OPE_RES=The result of the operation is:
OPE_RES_CONV=The operation is performed like this:
OPE_SX_CAI=The carry out resolve the operation we first have to convert all of the mixed fractions to improper fractions:
OPE_SX_EMP_CAI=To begin with the operation, all of the fractions must be represented in the same form, converting the fractions that are mixed fractions into improper fractions.
SUM_NX_DEN_DIF=We convert the fractions to equivalent fractions and they will have the same denominator:
SUM_NX_DEN_IGU=We perform the operations among the numerators:
SUM_SX_CONV_MCM=The numerator of each new fraction is equal to dividing the lcm calculated by the denominator of the fraction and then multiplying this result by the numerator of the fraction, the denominator of the new fraction will be the lcm.
SUM_SX_DEN=In the addition or subtraction of fractions, first we should analyze the denominators:
SUM_SX_DEN_DIF=When the denominators are different, we should express the fractions in such a form that they have the same denominator. To do this we calculate the least common multiple.
SUM_SX_DEN_IGU=When the denominators are equal, the operation is resolved directly, adding or subtracting the numerators as appropriate to the operation, and the denominator remains the same.
SUM_SX_OPE_NUMS=Finally, the operations among the numerators will be performed:
