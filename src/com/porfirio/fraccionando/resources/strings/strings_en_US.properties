FR_CAM_IND=Change to a mixed number, the following fraction:
FR_CAM_SX_DES=A fraction where the numerator is bigger than the denominator is improper. This means that it contains a whole number that can be extracted and from there a mixed number or mixed fraction can be obtained.
FR_CAM_NOIMP=This fraction is not improper, therefore, it can not be changed to a mixed fraction.
FR_CAM_SX_DET_ENT=The whole number results from dividing the numerator by the denominator plus a fraction.
FR_CAM_SX_DET_NUM=The numerator of the mixed fraction results from multiplying the whole number by the denominator and subtracting the result from the numerator of the original fraction;

FR_CAI_DEN_EXA=We will establish 1 as the denominator of the fraction
FR_CAI_SX_DES=A fraction that is expressed as a whole number plus a fractional part is a mixed fraction. The whole number of the mixed fraction can be added to its fractional part to change this mixed fraction to an improper fraction.
FR_CAI_SX_OPE=The numerator of the improper fraction is the result of the whole number of the mixed fraction multiplied by the denominator of its fractional part plus the numerator of the fractional part. The whole number is eliminated and the denominator remains the same.
FR_CAM_NOMIX=This is not a mixed fraction, it can not be converted.
FR_SIM_IND=Simplify the following fraction:
FR_SIM_SX_INT=To simplify a fraction means to reduce it to a more simple fraction.
FR_SIM_SX_CAM=Comparing the numerator with the denominator where the numerator is a bigger number, this fraction is an improper fraction and it can be converted to a mixed fraction.

FR_RESULTADO=What we end up with as the final result: 
OPE_SX_EMP_CAI=To begin with the operation, all of the fractions must be represented in the same form, converting the fractions that are mixed fractions into improper fractions.

CAL_MCD_IND=We will calculate the maximum common divisor (MCD) of the following numbers:
CAL_MCD_SX_EXP=The maximum common divisor (MCD) is the biggest number that a group of numbers is divisible by.
CAL_MCD_SX_INT=To calculate it, we have a test value that will start with 2, and we will divide all of the numbers by that test value, if the division of all of the numbers is exact, the test value will become a factor of the maximum common divisor (MCD).We continue testing with the same test value and when one of the divisions is not exact, then the test value increases to the next whole number and this same process is repeated. The calculation process ends when the test value becomes equal to one of the numbers.

CAL_MCM_SX_INT=To calculate it, we have test value that will start with 2, and we will divide all of the numbers by that test value. If the division of at least one of the numbers is exact, then the test value will become a factor of the least common multiple (lcm). We continue testing with the same test value and when none of the divisions is exact, then the test value increases to the next whole number and this same process is repeated. The calculation process ends when in the process of finding the factors of the lcm results in the original numbers becoming 1.

MUL_DIV_SX_GRUP=To solve an operation where we have multiplications and divisions together, we first group the first fraction with the other fractions that will be multiplied; after we have this result, we divide this result by the next fraction and then we divide this result by the following fraction and continue this process until we finish with the divisions.
